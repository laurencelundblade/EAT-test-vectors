# The value of the signer ID in sw components claim is 0x1f, an
# integer with an indefinite length. This not-well-formed CBOR
# should be caught at the lowest layer in the decoder and bubbled up
# to some top-level error. This is to test that path of bubbling up
# errors. There are lots of other ways that CBOR can be invalid
# here. This is just one to test the error propagation.
