# The value of the sw components claim is 0x1f, an integer with an
# indefinite length. This not-well-formed CBOR should be caught
# at the lowest layer in the decoder and bubbled up to some top-level
# error. This is to test that path of bubbling up errors. There are
# lots of other ways that CBOR can be invalid here. This is just one
# to test the error propagation.
